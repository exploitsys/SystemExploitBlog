## MUST READ
This is souly for education purposes only. I am not posting this for financial gain or to destroy league of legends. 
I am simply pointing out flaws in their security!


# Introduction
Firstly i would like to give credit to [wcscpy](https://twitter.com/wcscpy) for making this apparent to me! Without further ado welcome to the beginning of System Exploit Club! You should expect to learn about how League of Legends is extremely vulnerable & has very little integrity checks. We are going to be exposing the vulnerabilites with an application called [NetherBlade](https://github.com/hawolt/Netherblade/). Netherblade allows you to pretty much monitor and modify anything on the client and even lets you see what info is being sent to and from League of Legends servers. We will be using this to patch our new build version to a previous build and play on the live game.

# What we will cover
- Why?
- Finding build with League of Legends Api.
- Modifying build version to be previous build.
- Patching build version with NetherBlade.
- Possible ways for League Of Legends to prevent this.

# Dependencies
- Install java17
- Install [Intellij](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/?section=windows) so we can compile it
- Download or clone [NetherBlade](https://github.com/hawolt/Netherblade/) to ur project


# Whats the purpose for all this?
Currently league of legends doesnt do any integrity checks on the previous game build and allows connection to the game servers.
 But the servers are empty and only allow you to queue into a match with people on the same build. Which we can 
use to our advantage and basically give us **boosted lobbies**. We can do this by either having friends on alts accounts queue for a match on the same game build or if you dont have friends loading League of Legends inside of multiple vms, you will still need to login with alt accounts because they need to lose while we win. The reason this is such a big deal is because that means we can easily become top 10 in ranked relatively fast.


# Findings the build version
Here is a link to [league of legends api](https://sieve.services.riotcdn.net/api/v1/products/lol/version-sets/OC1?q[artifact_type_id]=lol-game-client&q[platform]=windows). Because the league of legends api is public information we were able to easily find the compatible game builds. You will need a json viewer extension for you web browser to look at the compatible game builds.  
**But which game build should we chose?** With this list we can see the latest game build and normally i would go just one below the latest. The reason is because League of Legends leaves their servers up for that game build ask me why and I couldnt tell you but we can abuse it!

# Adding to Netherblade
Once you have cloned Netherblade into Intellij you can now begin. You will need to create a new json file inside of the **main** directory
and call it **instructions.json**. Inside of json file you will need to add the following...  
```json
{
 "ingoing": {
  "body": [
  ]
},
 "outgoing": {
  "body": [
   {
    "method": "*",  
    "url": "https://(.*)/parties-ledge/v1/players/(.*)",
    "find": "\"gameClientVersion\":\"(.*?)\",",
    "type": "regex",
    "groups": [
      {
       "id": [
         1
       ],//gamebuild
       "replace": "13.19.5331909+branch.releases-13-19.code.public.content.release"
     }
    ]
   }
  ]
 }
}
```
After you have added the json file to the main directory save & run Netherblade(if you encounter issues simply open the folder and it should update the gui
if not then go into the directory Netherblade->src->main->resources->http->home).

# Patching to previous build
 After you load Netherblade you must load the game client with your region using the little rocket ship. After you have done so you can check if the patching of the new game build was succesfull by searching in the search bar **gameclient**, if you scroll all the way to the bottom and look to the left you will see some json that is defined like this.  
 ```json
 { //
  "accountId": 24315235,
  "createdAt": 0,
  "currentParty": null,
  "eligibilityHash": 0,
  "parties": null,
  "platformId": "NA1",
  "puuid": "01d41976-c9b5-5324-32p4iop24i",
  "registration": {
    "gameClientVersion": "13.19.5331909+branch.releases-13-19.code.public.content.release",//updated
    "inventoryToken": null,
    "inventoryTokens": [
      ""
    ],
    "playerTokens": {
      "idToken": "",
      "summonerToken": "",
      "userInfoToken": ""
    },
    "rankedOverviewToken": "",
    "simpleInventoryToken": "",
    "summonerToken": null
  },
  "serverUtcMillis": 0,
  "summonerId": 120324244,
  "version": 0
}
 
 ```
 Sometimes it will say that its patched but still put you in a game so the best way to check this is by either having someone trying to join you and then you will be promted with an error message that should look something like this.

 # Possible ways to combat this and prevent people from having boosted lobbies?
 I think this would be rather simple you literally could just do a check. I will give you a cpp example because its for chads.
 ```cpp
    std::vector<std::string> whitelist = {"user1", "user2", "user3"}; //our whitelist

    bool isUserWhitelisted(const std::string& username) { //loop through and check if the player is in whitelist
        for (const std::string& whitelistedUser : whitelist) {
            if (whitelistedUser == username)
                return true;
        }

        return false;
    }
    
 ``` 
This is just a really bare bones example on how they could potentially prevent people from playing on previous builds and boosting to get to the #1 Player in ranked realllly fast. Another would be to simply no longer keep the previous builds servers up lol.

# Summery
Like i said in the beginning its insane how vulnerable league of legends is, if you didnt notice from using Netherblades or what we talked about above we literally can see every packet sent and recieved. I hope you enjoyed and learned something from this post if you have any other ideas about the possibilites of this please join our [discord](https://discord.gg/xfMuDfK3xy) and talk to us about it or even other exploits you find for a chance to be featured on the blog! Goodluck hacking!
